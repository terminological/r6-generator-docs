# Default gitignore for r6-generator-maven-plugin projects.
# The general setup is to build and include the binary fat JAR
# during library development and deploy it from github
# however this may fall foul of CRAN's size policies.
# The alternative is to compile the source if needed during
# the first use of the R package.

# The standard Java exclusions are in the java subdirectory's own .gitignore
# the Java project is set up to be in subdirectory "java"
# meaning pom will be in java/pom.xml from the root of the java part of the project

# The standard R exclusions that follow assume the R package is in root directory of repository
# This is the default for the r6-generator-maven-plugin and makes most sense for packages deployed into a joint
# repository for Java and R code onto github where the root of the maven project is java/pom.xml, 
# The R package is then tested with github workflows and installed into R with devtools from github.
# most of these files are side effects of RStudio or package build tools.
