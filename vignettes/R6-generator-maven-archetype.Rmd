```{bash}

```

```{r cars}
fs::dir_tree(regexp="((.*/target)|docs|test)/.*", invert=TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
